# Project3

We are in the dilema to choose 2 topics:

Olympics:
Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=athlete_events.csv , https://odf.olympictech.org/project.htm
API: https://olympicsapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/olympics/athlete 
Questions:how many medals has Portugal won in 120 years? How does it compare to other countries?
How many athletes each country has taken to the games? How do they compare to each other?
Which country holds the most man medals, and woman medals.
We also can compare average ages, average heights, of each country. How do they change over the years? Is the average age going up or down? What about their height, are athletes becoming bigger or smaller? We can see the differences in both sexs too.
